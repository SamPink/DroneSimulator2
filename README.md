## Programming individual

 ## Description
 To create a drone simulation using JavaFx, the application should have a variety of different drones and other objects that move around an arena. That uses a structured object-oriented design having at least 1 abstract class
 

## Class diagram
Basic structure

 - GUI class
 - Canvas class
 - Arena class
 - Object class

 
## GUI
 - Menu
     - ~~Allows drone arena to be configured~~
     - ~~Saved and Edited~~
     - ~~Loaded (by default load from config)~~
     - ~~Run simulation~~
     - Help screen
 - Toolbar
     - ~~Buttons to control the simulation~~
     - ~~Start, Stop, Pause, Add objects~~
 - Information Panel
     - ~~Text descriptions or graphs~~
     - ~~Show state of the current arena~~
     - ~~Show contents of the arena~~ 
 - Feedback to the user instead of crashing

## Arena / Simulation

 - ~~Static and Moving objects~~
 - ~~Drones which turn when meet walls~~
 - Multiple drones with different behaviour
 - Charging stations
 -  Drone should be able to navigate static objects
 - 'Predator' drones
 - Player drone
